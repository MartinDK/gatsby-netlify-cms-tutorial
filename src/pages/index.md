  I try to share thoughts that are independent of any political tribe.
  Unfortunalely politics appears to have become a for profit business.

        I am interested in politics from a personal position - "how does it
        effect me", and ask the question "why does this exist - who does this
        serve."


        The world's diversity is what makes life interesting. Diversity doesn't
        need to create conflict if we respect people's freedom. 


        I don't aim to point out who is wrong, my goal is to see whose purpose
        is served by the political tribes. Unfortunately political tribes
        ambitions can become separated from what benefits society at large.


        #Ikigai is a Japanese concept that means "a reason for being." Good
        political systems don't undermine people's reason for being.
